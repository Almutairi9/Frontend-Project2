# Frontend-Project2
  site name :
 **News App**

# Description of the project
Our site is displaying some News from API.
users can have an account to sign up and log in.
Users can go between pages in an easier way.
our site is responsive and has a simple design.we made this site using React as frontend and we worked in Express.js as backend.

# API
I worked with API to get some data and display it on our site.
I got News and display it for users with React. 

# Function 
Register and login functions are a type of computer memory used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU.
We use it to admit users to have an account and have the ability to log in to our site.

# Function's parameters or arguments and returns 
I use standard Express parameters. “req” is for the request object. This is used in your Express route handler function to get data from the client (such as a web-browser). For example: username or order number could be attached to the req object. “res” is for the response object and you will use this in your Express route handler function to send data back to the client. For example: a 200 success status code and some data (often in json format) that your client requested from the server. “next” is used to call other “middle-ware” functions with Express which can handle other things such as logging or error handling. You can also name them something else such as (request, response) and sometimes you won’t need to use next so there may only be 2 arguments (req and res).
